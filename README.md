## Motivation
My AP Physics C class had a "Rube Goldberg" project where the goal was to create a contraption with multiple transfers of energy all working in succession to complete a simple goal. (e.g. watering a plant, turning on a light bulb, making ramen noodles, etc.) Our group decided to unlock a combination lock for our final goal, so I built a simple arduino device that spins the dial and lifts the shackle.
